## Main Functionalities
Use this list to block mass scans of your websites and block security probes. 

This is not a full list and you should still be actively monitoring your server logs.

## Advantages
 - Blocks automated website scans (SEO / Scraping / Security)
 - Reduces bounce rates
 - Reduces server load

## Disadvantages
 - This will not protect you from sophisticated attacks or advanced tools that rotate User Agents


## Warning
 - Please be careful not to block your internal services you use. Monitor your logs and services after deploying User Agent Block List.
